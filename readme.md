Cloud Seed is an algorithmic reverb plugin built in C# and C++ for emulating huge, endless spaces and modulated echoes. The algorithms are based on the same principles as manu classic studio reverb units from the 1980's, but Cloud Seed does not attempt to model any specific device, or even to be a general-purpose reverb plugin at all. It is best employed as a special effect, for creating thick, lush pads out of simple input sounds. 

## Cloud Seed Core - Open Source

If you are interested in using Cloud Seed in your own software, you can download the latest version of the core algorithm from the repository:
